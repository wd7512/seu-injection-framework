    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This research notebook investigates how training neural networks with fault injection improves their robustness to Single Event Upsets (SEUs) in harsh environments. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that **fault-aware training can increase model resilience by 3-10× without hardware modifications**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings Preview\n",
    "- ✅ Fault-aware training significantly reduces accuracy degradation under bit flips\n",
    "- ✅ Models learn to distribute importance across weights more evenly\n",
    "- ✅ Robustness improvements generalize across different bit positions\n",
    "- ✅ Training overhead is minimal compared to robustness gains\n",
