# Issue #64: [RESEARCH] How does training with flood levels improve robustness

### Question Category

Methodology (SEU injection strategies)

### Research Question

Floor levels are used to stop a model training at an earlier loss level (flood level). This is useful when it is known that a loss of 0 is infeasible or an overtrained model. How this impacts robustness is unknown

### Research Domain

Academic Research

### Model Architecture

Multiple Architectures

### Research Context

_No response_

### Code Example (if applicable)

```python
