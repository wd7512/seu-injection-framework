# Issue #22: [FEATURE] Add better hardcoded unit tests

### Feature Summary

I want some stronger checks that the bitflips are being performed in the correct location and in the correct way. 

### Feature Category

Testing/Quality Assurance

### Problem Statement

I want some stronger checks that the bitflips are being performed in the correct location and in the correct way. 

### Proposed Solution

Have some hardcoded tests. i.e. take a matrix [[0,1],[2,3]] and do a bit_i=0 at [1,1] to be [[0,1],[2,-3]]

```python

```
